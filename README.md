This repository serves as the foundation for my ePortfolio, developed as part of my Computer Science capstone project. It includes:

- A self-assessment detailing my skills and development throughout the Computer Science program.
- Links to a comprehensive code review and the code base of an older coursework project that inspired the capstone.
- Repositories showcasing my progress on the capstone project over the past weeks.
- Written narratives discussing my experiences and their relation to course outcomes.
