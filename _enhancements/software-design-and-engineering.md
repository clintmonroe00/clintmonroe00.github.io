# Software Design and Engineering

The repository for this enhancement is available [here](https://github.com/clintmonroe00/capstone-project/tree/sprint-one).

### Targeted Enhancements:

- **Frameworks:** Transitioning to React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend will enhance UI responsiveness, modularity, and scalability. React’s component-based structure allows for quicker, cleaner UI updates, while FastAPI’s asynchronous capabilities efficiently handle concurrent requests, reducing response times and boosting performance.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Using FastAPI and React facilitates quick MVP iterations, enabling faster adjustments based on user feedback. React’s reusable components and FastAPI’s automatic OpenAPI documentation streamline development and debugging.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** A React-based UI supports a more responsive and interactive experience, with options for advanced data visualization through libraries like D3.js or Plotly. Incorporating interactive map components, modal pop-ups, and custom filters will further engage users.
